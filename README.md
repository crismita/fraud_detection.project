# Fraud_Detection.project
This Fraud Detection system identifies potentially fraudulent transactions in financial datasets using machine learning.



## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate to help organizations reduce financial losses and improve transaction security.


---

## Objective

Identify fraudulent transactions

Build a reliable classification model

Support early fraud detection and prevention



---

## Machine Learning Approach

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature selection and scaling

Trained a classification model using Scikit-learn

Evaluated model performance using standard classification metrics



---

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains transaction-level information including:

Transaction features (numerical attributes)

Target variable indicating Fraud (1) or Not Fraud (0)



---

## Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub

Streamlit



---

## Project Workflow

1. Data loading and preprocessing


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


3. Feature engineering and scaling


4. Model training and evaluation


5. Prediction and result analysis




---

## Output

The model predicts whether a transaction is Fraudulent or Legitimate, helping in risk mitigation and fraud prevention.


---

## Future Improvements

Handle class imbalance more effectively

Try advanced models for better accuracy

Deploy model using Streamlit
